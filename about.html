  <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
  <p>Bertha's Deluxe Chocolates has been making quality chocolate and candy Mary See's way for over 90 years. From the beginning, Mary took pride in her recipes and insisted on only the finest, freshest ingredients. Today, we're still just as committed to making candy the right way. </p>
  <p>See's has expanded from one chocolate shop to over 200 shops across America and a flourishing online store. And though we continue to grow, our commitment to tradition, taste, service and quality never wavers.</p>
  <p>Stop into one of our iconic black-and-white shops inspired by Mary's kitchen, or visit us online. You'll find over 100 varieties of delicious candy, chocolates, and seasonal gifts made with the same motto in mind: quality without compromise®.</p>
<br />
<h2>INSIDE THE KITCHEN</h2>
<p>Since 1921, See's candies and chocolates have been made from scratch in our own candy kitchens. Using fresh ingredients, time-honored recipes and techniques, our Candy Makers truly make magic happen in the kitchen! Take a virtual tour and see for yourself how many of our famous chocolates and candies are made.</p>
<p>
Featuring delicious flavors from Bordeaux™ to Rocky Road, our large chocolate-covered Easter eggs are still artfully decorated by hand just as they have been since the beginning. Candy Makers use a pipette to create elegant designs and cute candy flowers, carefully hand-decorating each and every egg. It's quite a task—but the results speak for themselves.
